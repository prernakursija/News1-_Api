## 🧰 Code Example

```python
import requests  # pip install requests

query = input("What type of news are you interested in today?: ")
api = "98a21d3470fd45df8f14b9dfedb5aa3c"
url = f"https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q={query}&from=2025-09-07&sortBy=publishedAt&apiKey={api}"

print(url)

r = requests.get(url)
data = r.json()
articles = data["articles"]

for index, article in enumerate(articles):
    print(index + 1, article["title"], article["url"])
    print("\n************************************\n")
```

## ⚠️ Note

* Replace the `api` variable with your own **NewsAPI key** if needed.
* The free tier of NewsAPI may have some limitations on the number of requests per day.
